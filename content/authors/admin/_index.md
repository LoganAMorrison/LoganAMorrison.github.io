As a post-doctoral researcher, I research novel theories of dark matter, develop software to predict
potential experimental signals, and use current and prospective experiments to assess the viability and
potential discoverability of models. My current research projects include:

- Developing software for accurately computing gamma-ray, positron, and neutrino 
spectra from GeV-scale dark matter annihilations and decays using form-factors fit 
to electron/positron collider data.

- Computing spectra from dark matter annihilations and decays into sterile neutrinos with masses
ranging from an eV to the Plank scale.

- Using Sequential Neural Likelihood to chart the 24-dimensional parameter space of
the minimal supersymmetric model to identify regions that both contain dark matter and explain
anomalies in recent experiments probing the muon anomalous magnetic moment.

- Determining the effects on the cosmic microwave background from models where dark matter
briefly re-enters kinetic equilibrium with the Standard Model bath.
