abstract: Organic molecular crystals (OMCs) are of significant interest due to their
  potential use in transistors, photovoltaic devices, light emitting diodes, and other
  applications. However, conventional vacuum-based methods of growing crystalline
  OMC films are costly and provide limited control over crystal growth. In this study,
  we present a new method for preparing high performance single-crystal tetracene
  field-effect transistors under near-ambient conditions using organic vapor-liquid-solid
  (OVLS) deposition. We find that the mobility of OVLS-grown tetracene is comparable
  to high quality crystalline films prepared by physical vapor deposition. These results
  establish OVLS deposition as a relatively low cost, low substrate temperature, and
  ambient pressure method for growing high quality OMC films for device applications.
