  abstract = {Organic molecular crystals (OMCs) are of significant interest due to their potential use in transistors, photovoltaic devices, light emitting diodes, and other applications. However, conventional vacuum-based methods of growing crystalline OMC films are costly and provide limited control over crystal growth. In this study, we present a new method for preparing high performance single-crystal tetracene field-effect transistors under near-ambient conditions using organic vapor-liquid-solid (OVLS) deposition. We find that the mobility of OVLS-grown tetracene is comparable to high quality crystalline films prepared by physical vapor deposition. These results establish OVLS deposition as a relatively low cost, low substrate temperature, and ambient pressure method for growing high quality OMC films for device applications.}
