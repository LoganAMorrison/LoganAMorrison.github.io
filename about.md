Brief Bio
---------

I am a third-year, physics Ph.D. student studying theoretical high-energy physics. I obtained my bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics from Western Washington University in Washington state in 2015. I also have a masters degree in physics from UCSC.

Research Interests
------------------

My research interests are in dark matter phenomenology and electroweak baryogenisis. Recently, collaborators and I have been investigating possible indirect-detection signals from MeV-scale dark matter.

Current Projects
----------------

* **Indirect detection of MeV-Scale Dark Matter**

* **Gauge-independent GW Signals From EW  Phase Transition**

* **Constraints on Dark Matter EFTs From Direct Detection**
