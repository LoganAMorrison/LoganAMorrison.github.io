# About

I am a third-year, physics Ph.D. student studying theoretical high-energy physics. I obtained my bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics from Western Washington Univeristy in Washington state in 2015. I also have a masters degree in physics from UCSC.

# Research Interests

My research interests are in dark matter phenomenology and electroweak baryogenisis. Recently, collaborators and I have been investigating possible indirect-detection signals from MeV-scale dark matter.

# Projects 

## Indirect detection of MeV-Scale Dark Matter

## Gauge-independent Gravitational Wave Signals From Electroweak Phase Transition

## Constraints on Dark Matter Effective Field Theories From Direct Detection
